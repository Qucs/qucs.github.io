<h3>Why did the project rename?</h3>



The developers of Qucs have been asked to rename their software because

Qt&reg; is a registered trademark of Trolltech&reg;.  See the original

e-mail text below.  By 2005/07/04 Qucs now briefly for "Quite Universal

Circuit Simulator" instead of "Qt universal circuit simulator".

Dear Michael Margraf,



I am writing to you in connection with your product Qucs, which I was

recently made aware of.



There are two issues that I would like to bring to your attention:



1) The product seems to be GPL'ed, _and_ there seems to be a Windows

version. However, Qt is not GPL'ed on Windows (although it will be for

Qt 4.0). It would be great if you could clarify this for us.



2) Qucs seems to be an abbreviation for Qt Universal Circuit Simulator.



 While Trolltech is enthused that the use of Qt is widespread, we would like

 to point you to the fact that the Qt name belongs to Trolltech. As Qt is a

 trademark of Trolltech and registered in a number of countries world-wide,

 we are unfortunately not in a position to let others develop and market

 products including the Qt name.



Provided we sort out issue no. 1 and you comply with the license

requirements, Trolltech is fine with the fact that you mention that your



 product has been developed using Qt. We are, unfortunately not fine with

 your product name incorporating our registered trademark. We kindly ask you

 to rename your product in order to reflect that the trademark does not

 belong to you. If you want to reference Qt on your website, please make a

 reference to our trademarks somewhere on your site. Please refer to

 http://www.trolltech.com/company/copyright.html for more information.



Please let me know if there is anything I can assist you with.



Best regards,

Cathrine Bore
