<h3>Answers</h3>

<p>
<a name="q001"><b>1. On which OS will Qucs run?</b></a><br>
Qucs is currently developed on GNU/Linux systems using the GNU
autotools.  For this reason it is very likely that Qucs runs on all
kinds of Unix systems supporting an appropriate system interface and
an installed Qt&reg; environment.  It has been verified that Qucs can be
installed on GNU/Linux, Solaris 2.9, MacOS 10.3, NetBSD, FreeBSD and
Cygwin (Unix emulation layer for Windows).  With the QT3/Windows Free
Edition at hand Qucs is also available natively on Win32 (NT/2000/XP) systems.

</p>

<p>
<a name="q002"><b>2. What kind of software is need to be installed on my system to run Qucs?</b></a><br>
The main branch uses Qt4, the old (and for now more stable) qucs-qt3 branch depends on Qt&reg; &gt;= 3.1 (and &lt; 4.0.0) by
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Trolltech</a>&reg;<br>
to compile qucs you will need some additional packages like qt4-dev-tools, bison, flex, gperf and adms-2.3.0
</p>

<p>
<a name="q003"><b>3. Why don't you use Spice to simulate the schematics?</b></a><br>
There are several debatable reason for this.  When looking at the Spice3f.5
source code (i.e. the last version with technical support from the
University of California) it seems like the program was made as a
proof of concept rather than a ready to use application.  In fact the code
is not easy to extend though possibly reliable and tested for a great
variaty of schematics.  The original Spice misses a S-parameter
and harmonic balance simulation which may be necessary for microwave
engineers, thus Spice would not be an all-in-one solution.  Of cource there
are trillions of derivates of the last official Spice version extending
and bug-fixing it: but which shall we use?  Last but not least the licence
issue.  The copyright holder for the Spice code are the Regents of the 
University of California.  The code comes for free but isn't in fact meant
to be re-used.<br><br>
Some more restriction of Spice3f.5
<ul>
<li>limited number of nodes and devices (student version)
</li>
<li>though implemented and possibly ready-to-use the integration
order (for the Gear formulae) won't exceed 2 in the transient
simulation code
</li>
<li>there are no such components as phaseshifter, isolator, circulator,
microstrip components, etc.
</li>
<li>the frontend isn't as good as it could be
</li>
</ul>

<a name="q004"><b>4. Compiling Qucs ends with something like "g++: ./componentdialog.moc.cpp: Can't find file or directory".</b></a><br>
If <tt>*.moc.cpp</tt> files cannot be compiled the Meta Object Compiler
is missing. There was surely the message<br>
<pre>
...
checking for moc... :
checking for uic... /usr/bin/uic
configure: WARNING:
  The qucs package needs the 'Qt Meta Object Compiler' to compile properly.
  Though Qt itself may be properly installed including headers and libraries
  the 'moc' program is missing.  Possibly you need to install the full
  development package of Qt.
...
</pre>
during ./configure run. Either <tt>moc</tt> is not on the system (should not be
the case if Qt&reg; is installed) or the environment variable <tt>MOC</tt> does not
exist. Find the location of <tt>moc</tt> (for Knoppix <tt>/usr/bin/moc-qt3</tt> or
<tt>/usr/share/qt3/bin/moc</tt>) and type<br>
<pre>
	$ export MOC=/usr/bin/moc-qt3
</pre>
just before calling ./configure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="q005"><b>5. The ./configure script finds Qt&reg; headers, but cannot locate the libraries.  What's wrong?</b></a><br>
Though the <tt>QTDIR</tt> environment variable is setup correctly, it may happen
that the configure script cannot find the Qt&reg; libraries because it is initially looking
for the threaded libraries (the <tt>libqt-mt.so</tt> link).  If you have installed
the non-threaded library (the <tt>libqt.so</tt> link) configure fails.  This can be
worked around by
<pre>
	$ ./configure --disable-mt
</pre>
On the other hand it may happen that ./configure finds the Qt&reg; headers by chance if the
<tt>QTDIR</tt> environment variable is not setup at all but fails to find the libraries
then.  Try
<pre>
	$ export QTDIR=/path/to/qt
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<a name="q006"><b>6. I downloaded and installed the Qucs package on MacOSX, and then when I try to start it the Qucs icon appears in my dock briefly and then disappears and the program quits.  What's wrong?</b></a><br>
The Qucs package for MacOSX requires the QT3.x libraries.  The MacOSX
versions of the QT3.x libraries are available on the same download
site as "minimal" and "complete" package.  The "minimal" version is
for users who want to use the Qt-based applications available at <a
href="http://naranja.umh.es/~atg">http://naranja.umh.es/~atg</a>.  The
"complete" versions is for developers, i.e. including Qt Designer, all
example programs and documentation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="q007"><b>7. How can I set the language for Qucs?</b></a><br>
If you want to change the language for the Qucs GUI you need to quit Qucs and
then
<pre>
	$ export LANG=de
</pre>
for German for example.  Then start Qucs again.  Also you can change
the language in the application settings dialog (in the file menu).
</p>

<p>
<a name="q008"><b>8. Qucs does not start on my MacOSX.  What's wrong?</b></a><br>

Qucs relies in parts on libraries which are not delivered with MacOSX,
but with the X11-installer Apple provides.  This does not mean that
Qucs on MacOSX runs under X-Windows, the binary installer provided on
<a href="http://naranja.umh.es/~atg">http://naranja.umh.es/~atg</a> is
based on the native version of Trolltech's Qt3.3 framework, but some
libs from the X11-packages are used.  This is a requirement under
MacOSX 10.3 as well as 10.4.x (and it is displayed by the installer
before starting the installation).  The X11-installer from Apple,
which installs the missing libraries, is available from the MacOSX
installation CDs/DVD (well, and it is not installed as default when
doing a "standard" MacOSX installation).  The X11-installer package is
available within the optional packages accessible from the MacOSX
System installer.  If X11 is installed from at least the Apple
provided installer, the libs are available.

<a name="q009"><b>9. I try to run the ASCO optimizer and it gave me the following error: 'qucsator' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</b></a><br>
The optimizer ASCO runs the 'qucsator' program to perform
optimizations.  Therefore the 'qucsator' program which is the backend
simulator for Qucs needs to reside in the program PATH
environment.<br><br>
Under GNU/Linux or similar do
<pre>
	$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/qucsator
</pre>
On Win32 systems go to "Start", "Settings", "System properties", click on
"Advanced" tab.  In the "Advanced" section click the "Environment
Variables" button.  There edit or add the <tt>PATH</tt> environment
variable to point to the path where 'qucsator.exe' resides.
</p>

<p>
<a name="q010"><b>10. I use the Windows version of Qucs.  After installing it, I can't use it when logged in as different user.  Simulation cannot be started, projects are away and/or icons don't appear properly in the GUI.  What's wrong?</b></a><br>

Don't panic!  Under Windows environment variables are used to steer
"relocation", meaning how a program knows where it resides.  During
installation these environment variable are set up.  These are user
specific (even when installed as "Administrator").  If you want to use
Qucs two variables are most important: <tt>QUCSDIR</tt> and
<tt>HOME</tt>.<br><br>

<tt>QUCSDIR</tt> specifies where qucs is installed.  On Win32 systems
go to "Start", "Settings", "System properties", click on "Advanced"
tab.  In the "Advanced" section click the "Environment Variables"
button.  There edit or add the <tt>QUCSDIR</tt> environment variable
to point to the path Qucs is installed (e.g.,
<tt>C:\Programs\Qucs</tt>).<br><br>

The <tt>HOME</tt> variable is used to identify where settings and
project data are stored.  Even for network drives you can let point it
to e.g. <tt>H:\</tt>.  In this folder a directory <tt>.qucs/</tt> is
created and used to store project related files.
