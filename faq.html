    <h3>Answers</h3>

    <p><a name="q001" id="q001"><b>1. On which OS will Qucs
    run?</b></a><br />
    Qucs is currently developed on GNU/Linux systems using the GNU
    autotools (and CMake experimentally).
    For this reason it is very likely that Qucs runs on
    all kinds of Unix systems supporting an appropriate system
    interface and an installed Qt&reg; environment. It has been
    verified that Qucs can be installed on GNU/Linux, Solaris 2.9,
    MacOS 10.5, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Cygwin (Unix emulation layer
    for Windows).
    Qucs is
    also available natively on x86 Windows (XP/Vista/7/8) systems
    and experimentaly on x86_64 versions of these. </p>

    <p><a name="q002" id="q002"><b>2. What kind of software is need
    to be installed on my system to run Qucs?</b></a><br />
    Currently Qt4 (version 4.6 and higher) are known to work well.
    To compile qucs you will need some additional packages like
    qt4-dev-tools, bison, flex, gperf and adms-2.3.0 (included into Qucs)</p>

    <p><a name="q003" id="q003"><b>3. Why don't you use Spice to
    simulate the schematics?</b></a><br />
    There are several debatable reason for this. When looking at
    the Spice3f.5 source code (i.e. the last version with technical
    support from the University of California) it seems like the
    program was made as a proof of concept rather than a ready to
    use application. In fact the code is not easy to extend though
    possibly reliable and tested for a great variaty of schematics.
    The original Spice misses a S-parameter and harmonic balance
    simulation which may be necessary for microwave engineers, thus
    Spice would not be an all-in-one solution. Of cource there are
    trillions of derivates of the last official Spice version
    extending and bug-fixing it: but which shall we use? Last but
    not least the licence issue. The copyright holder for the Spice
    code are the Regents of the University of California. The code
    comes for free but isn't in fact meant to be re-used.<br />
    <br />
    Some more restriction of Spice3f.5</p>

    <ul>
      <li>limited number of nodes and devices (student
      version)</li>

      <li>though implemented and possibly ready-to-use the
      integration order (for the Gear formulae) won't exceed 2 in
      the transient simulation code</li>

      <li>there are no such components as phaseshifter, isolator,
      circulator, microstrip components, etc.</li>

      <li>the frontend isn't as good as it could be</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="q004" id="q004"><b>4. How can I set the language
    for Qucs?</b></a><br />
    If you want to change the language for the Qucs GUI you need to
    quit Qucs and then</p>
    <pre>
        $ export LANG=de
</pre>for German for example. Then start Qucs again. Also you can
change the language in the application settings dialog (in the file
menu).

    <p><a name="q005" id="q005"><b>5. Qucs does not start on my
    MacOSX. What's wrong?</b></a><br />
    Please contact the developers. Provide details and if available a
    crash report.</p>

    <p><a name="q006" id="q006"><b>6. I try to run the ASCO
    optimizer and it gave me the following error: 'qucsator' is not
    recognized as an internal or external command, operable program
    or batch file.</b></a><br />
    The optimizer ASCO runs the 'qucsator' program to perform
    optimizations. Therefore the 'qucsator' program which is the
    backend simulator for Qucs needs to reside in the program PATH
    environment.<br />
    <br />
    Under GNU/Linux or similar do</p>
    <pre>
        $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/qucsator
</pre>On Win32 systems go to "Start", "Settings", "System
properties", click on "Advanced" tab. In the "Advanced" section
click the "Environment Variables" button. There edit or add the
<tt>PATH</tt> environment variable to point to the path where
'qucsator.exe' resides.

    <p><a name="q007" id="q007"><b>7. I use the Windows version of
    Qucs. After installing it, I can't use it when logged in as
    different user. Simulation cannot be started, projects are away

    wrong?</b></a><br />
    Don't panic! Under Windows environment variables are used to
    steer "relocation", meaning how a program knows where it
    resides. During installation these environment variable are set
    up. These are user specific (even when installed as
    "Administrator"). If you want to use Qucs two variables are
    most important: <tt>QUCSDIR</tt> and <tt>HOME</tt>.<br />
    <br />
    <tt>QUCSDIR</tt> specifies where qucs is installed. On Win32
    systems go to "Start", "Settings", "System properties", click
    on "Advanced" tab. In the "Advanced" section click the
    "Environment Variables" button. There edit or add the
    <tt>QUCSDIR</tt> environment variable to point to the path Qucs
    is installed (e.g., <tt>C:\Programs\Qucs</tt>).<br />
    <br />
    The <tt>HOME</tt> variable is used to identify where settings
    and project data are stored. Even for network drives you can
    let point it to e.g. <tt>H:\</tt>. In this folder a directory
    <tt>.qucs/</tt> is created and used to store project related
    files.</p>
