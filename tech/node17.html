<H1><A NAME="SECTION00440000000000000000">
Overall solution algorithm for DC Analysis</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this section an overall solution algorithm for a DC analysis for
linear as well as non-linear networks is given.  With non-linear
network elements at hand the Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm is applied.

<P>

<P>
The algorithm shown in fig. <A HREF="#fig:dcalgo">3.7</A> has been proved to be
able to find DC solutions for a large variety of networks.  It must be
said that the application of any of the fallback convergence helpers
indicates a nearly or definitely singular equation system
(e.g. floating nodes or overdetermining sources).  The convergence
problems are either due to an apparently ``wrong'' network topology or
to the model implementation of non-linear components.  For some of the
problems also refer to the facts mentioned in section <A HREF="node99.html#sec:linEQS">15.2</A>
on page <A HREF="node99.html#sec:linEQS"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.  In some cases it may even occur that
tiny numerical inaccuracies lead to non-convergences whereas the
choice of a more accurate (but probably slower) equation system solver
can help.  With network topologies having more than a single stable
solution (e.g. bistable flip-flops) it is recommended to apply
nodesets, i.e. forcing the Newton-Raphson iteration into a certain
direction by initial values.

<P>
<P>
When having problems to get a circuit have its DC solution the
following actions can be taken to solve these problems.

<UL>
<LI>check circuit topology (e.g. floating nodes or overdetermining sources)
</LI>
<LI>check model parameters of non-linear components
</LI>
<LI>apply nodesets
</LI>
<LI>choose a more accurate equation system solver
</LI>
<LI>relax the convergence tolerances if possible
</LI>
<LI>increase the maximum iteration count
</LI>
<LI>choose the prefered fallback algorithm
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The presented concepts are common to most circuit simulators each
having to face the mentioned aspects.  And probably facing it in a
different manner with more or less big differences in their
implementation details especially regarding the (fallback) convergence
helpers.  None of the algorithms based on Newton-Raphson ensures
global convergence, thus very few documents have been published either
for the complexity of the topic or for uncertainties in the detailed
implementation each carrying the attribute ``can help'' or ``may
help''.

<P>
<P>
So for now the application of a circuit simulator to find the DC
solution of a given network sometimes keeps being a task for people
knowing what they want to achieve and what they can roughly expect.
