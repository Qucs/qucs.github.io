      <li style="list-style: none">There is an installer package
      for Qucs for Win32 systems named
        <pre>
        qucs-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>The relocations of the package (the location where the
package gets installed) is mainly steered by environment variables.
During a normal installation the appropriate environment variables
are automatically set for the user who installed the package.<br />

        <br />
        One of them must be emphasised: <b>HOME</b>. During
        installation an appropriate file system location will be
        found. When it was already set then the previous value is
        assumed. The location decides where the project,
        intermediate and configuration files will be saved. So when
        the user wonders about missing project files or lost
        configuration it's worth to have a look at the environment
        variables.<br />
        <br />
        If <b>FreeHDL</b> is meant to be used for digital
        simulation then also the binary installer package named
        <pre>
        freehdl-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>must be downloaded and installed. It requires the
<b>MinGW32</b> compiler. If it is not already installed, it's
possible to install a prepared binary package for this, too.
        <pre>
        mingw32-g++-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>It contains the minimal MinGW32 installation required to work
with FreeHDL and should be installed proir to the FreeHDL
package.<br />
        <br />
        If <b>Icarus Verilog</b> is used for digital Verilog-HDL
        simulation the installer script
        <pre>
        iverilog-&lt;version&gt;_setup.exe
</pre>must be installed on the computer additionally. Please note
that it is necessary to install it in a <u>path location without
spaces</u> due to a limitation in the software. Current versions
can be obtained at <a href=
"http://bleyer.org/icarus/">http://bleyer.org/icarus/</a>.<br />

        <br />
        In order to use the SPICE preprocessor <b>ps2sp</b>
        successfully a <b>TinyPerl</b> installation is required. It
        can be obtained at <a href=
        "http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/">http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/</a>.
        It must be ensured that the <b>tinyperl.exe</b> is
        accessible via the PATH environment variable.

          <li style="list-style: none">
            <br />
            To install Qucs, you need to install MacPorts (after Xcode and Command Line Tools, see below).<br />
            <br />

            <ol>

              <li>
                <i>Installing MacPorts and Qucs</i><br />
                With MacPorts you can
                install MacOS versions of many known open source
                projects by using simple commands.<br />
                <br />
                Get it here: <a href=
                "http://www.macports.org/">http://www.macports.org/</a><br />

                <br />

                Please follow the installation instructions to get Xcode and the Command Line Tools.

                After its installation,
                MacPorts needs to be updated to the most recent
                version. Open a Terminal shell and type the following
                commmand (you will be asked for your password):
        <pre>
        $ sudo port -d selfupdate
        </pre>

               Now it is time to get Qucs. In the shell, type this command:
        <pre>
        $ sudo port install qucs
        </pre>

              MacPorts will fetch, decompress, compile and install a lot of
packages which are needed to install Qucs. Be patient, this will
take some time.

<br />
<br />
                After installation Qucs will be placed into
                /opt/local/bin. If you want, you can create a link
                to your Applications folder with the following
                command:

        <pre>
        $ sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/qucs /Applications/qucs
        </pre>
              </li>
            </ol>You're done!<br />
            <br />
          </li>

          <li><b>Binary installer package</b></li>

          <li style="list-style: none">
            <br />
            There is also an installer package for Qucs for MacOSX
            systems named
            <pre>
        qucs-&lt;version&gt;-macosx-&lt;platform&gt;.pkg
</pre>Copy this file onto your desktop and double-click it. Follow
the installer instructions.
