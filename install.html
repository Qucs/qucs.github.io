<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
</a>

<ul>
<li>
<h4>Requirements</h4></li>
<p>
Qucs needs Qt&reg; by
<a href="http://qt.digia.com/">Digia</a>&reg;.
The current version is known to work with Qt 4.6.3 and later.
</p>

<li>
<h4>Usual GNU/Linux installation</h4></li>
<p>
Unpack the distribution tarball:

<pre>
    $ tar xvzf qucs-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)
</pre>
Change into the source directory:

<pre>
    $ cd qucs-&lt;version&gt;
</pre>
Configure the source package for your system:

<pre>
    $ ./configure
</pre>
Now compile the package:

<pre>
    $ make
</pre>
Install Qucs:

<pre>
    $ make install
</pre>

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable 
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in the distribution.<br><br>

<b>Please note</b>:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably
gmake) to compile and install the package.

<li>
<a name="#install_Win32">
<h4>Install instructions for Win32</h4></li>
</a>

There is an installer package for Qucs for Win32 systems named
<pre>
	qucs-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>
The relocations
of the package (the location where the package gets installed) is mainly
steered by environment variables. During a normal installation the
appropriate environment variables are automatically set for the user who
installed the package.<br><br>

One of them must be emphasised: <b>HOME</b>. During installation an appropriate
file system location will be found. When it was already set then the
previous value is assumed. The location decides where the project,
intermediate and configuration files will be saved. So when the user
wonders about missing project files or lost configuration it's worth to
have a look at the environment variables.<br><br>

If <b>FreeHDL</b> is meant to be used for digital simulation then also
the binary installer package named
<pre>
	freehdl-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>
must be downloaded and installed. It requires the <b>MinGW32</b>
compiler. If it is not already installed, it's possible to install a
prepared binary package for this, too.
<pre>
 	mingw32-g++-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>
It contains the minimal MinGW32 installation required to work with FreeHDL
and should be installed proir to the FreeHDL package.<br><br>

If <b>Icarus Verilog</b> is used for digital Verilog-HDL simulation the
installer script
<pre>
 	iverilog-&lt;version&gt;_setup.exe
</pre>
must be installed on the computer additionally.  Please note that it is necessary to
install it in a <u>path location without spaces</u> due to a limitation in the
software.  Current versions can be obtained at <a href="http://bleyer.org/icarus/">
http://bleyer.org/icarus/</a>.<br><br>

In order to use the SPICE preprocessor <b>ps2sp</b> successfully a <b>TinyPerl</b>
installation is required.  It can be obtained at <a href="http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/">
http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/</a>.  It must be ensured that the <b>tinyperl.exe</b>
is accessible via the PATH environment variable.

<h4>Install instructions for MacOSX</h4></li>
</a>
There are several ways to install Qucs under MacOSX.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Building Qucs from downloaded source tarball</b></li><br>
To build Qucs from source, you need to install X11 and Qt first.<br><br>
<ol>
<li><i>Installing X11</i></li>
<p>
To install X11 (if you do not already have it), insert your MacOS
installation DVD, scroll down, open "Optional Installs" and choose
the package "X11" for installation. Finish the installation.
</p>
<li><i>Installing Qt</i></li>
<p>
An easy way of installing Qt3 is using DarwinPorts. With DarwinPorts
you can install MacOS versions of many known open source
projects by using simple commands.<br><br>

Get it here: <a href="http://darwinports.com/">http://darwinports.com/</a>
<br><br>
Download the .dmg file from there, open it and install the DarwinPorts
package. After that, DarwinPorts needs to be updated to the
most recent version. Open a shell and type the following commmand
(you will be asked for your password):
<pre>
	$ sudo port -d selfupdate
</pre>
Now it is time to get Qt3. In the shell, type this command:
<pre>
	$ sudo port install qt3
</pre>
Now DarwinPorts will fetch a lot of packages which are needed to
install Qt3. Be patient, this will take some time. Once finished,
you need to export a new environment variable. Do this by typing
the following two lines into your shell:
<pre>
	$ QTDIR=/opt/local/lib/qt3
	$ export QTDIR
</pre>
Do not close the shell, we'll need it with the above environment
variable for the installation of Qucs.
</p>
<li><i>Compiling Qucs</i></li>
<p>
You should get the latest version of Qucs now. I wrote this article
using qucs-0.0.11, but this should work for future versions, too.
<br><br>
I assume you have downloaded the Qucs source code to
Documents/qucs-0.0.11.tar.gz, so we can use our shell to extract
the source files with the following commands:
<pre>
	$ cd Documents
	$ tar ­xvzf qucs-0.0.11.tar.gz
</pre>
Now compile Qucs:
<pre>
	$ cd qucs-0.0.11
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/qucs /Applications/qucs
</pre>
</ol>
If everything went ok, you should now have a link to the binary "qucs"
in your Applications. You're done!
</p>

<li><b>Building using MacPorts</b></li><br>
To install Qucs, you need to install X11, XCode and MacPorts first.
<br><br>
<ol>
<li><i>Installing X11</i></li><br>
To install X11 (if you do not already have it), insert your MacOS
installation DVD, scroll down, open "Optional Installs" and choose the
package "X11" for installation. Finish the installation.
<br><br>
<li><i>Installing XCode</i></li><br>
XCode is a mighty package for software developers. It comes with a fully
fledged GUI, several programming languages and lots of documentation. We
only need the C compiler (gcc) and its support files which come with this
installation.<br><br>

To check if XCode is already installed, open your Finder, then your
"Macintosh HD" and look for a folder "Developer". If it's there, XCode is
installed and you can skip the following step.<br><br>

You have two choices:
<ol type="a">
<li>download the newest version (over 900 MB for v2.4.1!)</li>
Goto <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/index.html">
http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/index.html</a>.
After download, open the .dmg image and run the installer.
<br>
<li>use the older version from DVD</li>
Look through your Tiger installation media for "XCode tools". Install it.
</ol>
<br>
<li><i>Installing MacPorts and Qucs</i></li><br>
With MacPorts (formerly DarwinPorts) you can install MacOS versions of many
known open source projects by using simple commands.<br>
<br>
Get it here: <a href="http://www.macports.org/">http://www.macports.org/</a>
<br><br>
Download the latest .dmg file from there, open it and install the MacPorts
package. After that, MacPorts needs to be updated to the most recent version.
Open a shell and type the following commmand (you will be asked for your
password):
<pre>
	$ sudo port -d selfupdate
</pre>
Now it is time to get Qucs. In the shell, type this command:
<pre>
	$ sudo port install qucs
</pre>
MacPorts will fetch, decompress, compile and install a lot of packages which
are needed to install Qucs. Be patient, this will take some time.
<br><br>
After installation Qucs will be placed into /opt/local/bin. If you want, you
can create a link to your Applications folder with the following command:
<pre>
	$ sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/qucs /Applications/qucs
</pre>
</ol>
You're done!<br><br>

<li><b>Binary installer package</b></li><br>
There is also an installer package for Qucs for MacOSX systems named
<pre>
	qucs-&lt;version&gt;-macosx-&lt;platform&gt;.pkg
</pre>
Copy this file onto your desktop and double-click it.  Follow the
installer instructions.
