      The stable PPA (Personal Package Archive) for Ubuntu is located
      <a href="https://launchpad.net/~qucs/+archive/ubuntu/qucs/+packages"> here</a>.
      </br>
      </br>
      Qucs 0.0.18 packages are available for Ubuntu versions 14.10 (Utopic) and 14.04 (Trusty).
      </br>
      </br>
      Qucs 0.0.17 packages are available for Ubuntu versions 13.04 (Raring), 12.10 (Quantal), and 12.04 (Precise).

      </br>
      </br>
      To add the package repository and install Qucs, use the following sequence of commands:

      <pre>
      sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qucs/qucs
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install qucs
      </pre>

        Win32</a></h4>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style: none">There is an installer package
      for Qucs for Win32 systems named
        <pre>
        qucs-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>The relocations of the package (the location where the
package gets installed) is mainly steered by environment variables.
During a normal installation the appropriate environment variables
are automatically set for the user who installed the package.<br />

        <br />
        One of them must be emphasised: <b>HOME</b>. During
        installation an appropriate file system location will be
        found. When it was already set then the previous value is
        assumed. The location decides where the project,
        intermediate and configuration files will be saved. So when
        the user wonders about missing project files or lost
        configuration it's worth to have a look at the environment
        variables.<br />
        <br />
        If <b>FreeHDL</b> is meant to be used for digital
        simulation then also the binary installer package named
        <pre>
        freehdl-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>must be downloaded and installed. It requires the
<b>MinGW32</b> compiler. If it is not already installed, it's
possible to install a prepared binary package for this, too.
        <pre>
        mingw32-g++-&lt;version&gt;-setup.exe
</pre>It contains the minimal MinGW32 installation required to work
with FreeHDL and should be installed proir to the FreeHDL
package.<br />
        <br />
        If <b>Icarus Verilog</b> is used for digital Verilog-HDL
        simulation the installer script
        <pre>
        iverilog-&lt;version&gt;_setup.exe
</pre>must be installed on the computer additionally. Please note
that it is necessary to install it in a <u>path location without
spaces</u> due to a limitation in the software. Current versions
can be obtained at <a href=
"http://bleyer.org/icarus/">http://bleyer.org/icarus/</a>.<br />

        <br />
        In order to use the SPICE preprocessor <b>ps2sp</b>
        successfully a <b>TinyPerl</b> installation is required. It
        can be obtained at <a href=
        "http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/">http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/</a>.
        It must be ensured that the <b>tinyperl.exe</b> is
        accessible via the PATH environment variable.
